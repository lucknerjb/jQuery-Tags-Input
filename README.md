# jQuery Tags Input Plugin

## Note:
This project is based off of [the original plugin](https://github.com/xoxco/jQuery-Tags-Input). Unfortunately, it has not been maintained in quite a while (~ 18 months when I started).

## Goal:
- Fix certain issues that have gone unresolved in the original repo
- Add some new features to the plugin
- Add test cases and setup Travis CI to allow for collaborators to make this plugin usable for everyone

I will update this readme soon and will include a link to the project's roadmap as well.
